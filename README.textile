h1. is_rateable

Currently star buttons are a put request, not a post request like they should be due to time constraints. Should be fixed in a future version. 

Patches welcome! I do test my own stuff but until I find a nice and easy way to include rspec in plugins, they won't come with the specs.

h2. Usage

To install, type <code>script/generate rateable</code>

In your model.
<code>
  <pre>
    is_rateable :upto => 5 # it defaults :upto => 5
  </pre>
</code>

In your view.
<code>
  <pre>
    render_rating(@book, :interactive_stars)
    render_rating(@book) # If you want to also see 1/5 Stars
  </pre>
</code>

If a user rates more than twice, it will delete their older rating and put up a new rating.

Add a method to your books_controller like so:
<code>
  <pre>
    def rate
      @book = Book.find(params[:id])
      unless @book.add_rating(params[:rating].to_i, :ip => request.remote_ip)
        flash[:notice] = "You have already voted on this book"
      end
      redirect_to @book
    end
  </pre>
</code>
